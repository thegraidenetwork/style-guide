# Styleguide - The Graide Network

A quick-and-dirty frontend styleguide for The Graide Network internal use.

## Setting up this project
It's an HTML document, so it should be as simple as pulling down this repository
and opening `index.html` in your favorite web browser.

## Using this styleguide
This is intended to be used as a reference for frontend development at The Graide Network.
Currently it uses its own stylesheets, but as we refine and implement the guide, we intend
on calling the stylesheets from our application directly.

#### During design/mockup
- Copy/paste elements that you'd like to incorporate
- Or label elements as named in the styleguide
- If an element isn't in the styleguide or it deviates from this guide, make a note so that developer know to create a custom implementation

#### During development
- Refer to this document when deciding how to style standard elements
- Update this document when new elements are required
