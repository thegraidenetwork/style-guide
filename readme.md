# Styleguide - The Graide Network

A quick-and-dirty frontend styleguide for The Graide Network internal use based on [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/).

## Setting up this project
It's an HTML document, so it should be as simple as cloning this repository and opening `index.html` in your favorite web browser.

## Using this styleguide
This is intended to be used as a reference for frontend development at [The Graide Network](http://www.thegraidenetwork.com/):

#### During product spec/mockup process
- Copy/paste elements that you'd like to incorporate
- Or take a screenshot of the element you'd like to use in the styleguide.
- If an element isn't in the styleguide or it deviates from this guide, make a note so that developers know to create a custom implementation

#### During development
- Refer to this document when deciding how to style standard elements
- Try to default to using style standards that have already been outlined
- When necessary, add new elements to this styleguide
